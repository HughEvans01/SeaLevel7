            <p>
             A Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gasses (including carbon dioxide and methane) 
that are generated by our actions. Globally the average person have a Carbon Footprint closer to 4 Tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop under 2 tons by 2050.

            <h2>The main causes of climate change are:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Burning fossil fuels</li>
              <li>Deforestation and tree clearing</li>
              <li>Rapid industrialisation</li>
              <li>Transport</li>
              <li>Pollution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scientists agree that the earth’s rising temperatures are fueling longer and hotter heat waves, more frequent droughts, heavier rainfall, and more powerful hurricanes. In 2015, for example, scientists said that an ongoing drought in California—the state’s worst water shortage in 1,200 years—had been intensified by 15 percent to 20 percent by global warming. They also said the odds of similar droughts happening in the future had roughly doubled over the past century. And in 2016, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine announced that it’s now possible to confidently attribute certain weather events, like some heat waves, directly to climate change.</p>
